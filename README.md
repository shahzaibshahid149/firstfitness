 Document Structure
The page uses semantic HTML with clear sections: nav, section, footer, etc., enhancing accessibility and SEO.

It uses the Bootstrap Icons CDN for scalable, vector-based icons.

2. Styling Concepts
Reset styles like * { margin: 0; padding: 0; } are used to ensure consistency across browsers.

Typography and Color: A professional sans-serif font is applied globally; a consistent color scheme (#4361ee blue and neutral grays) ensures brand identity.

Utility classes (.btn, .container, .form-group, etc.) promote reusability.

3. Layout and Responsiveness
The layout is built using Flexbox, especially for:

Navbar alignment (justify-content: space-between)

About and service item layouts (display: flex; gap: 40px;)

Media queries adjust layout for smaller screens (@media (max-width: 768px)), making the site mobile-friendly.

4. User Interface Components
Navbar: Sticky, shadowed, includes logo, links, and auth buttons.

Hero Section: Eye-catching intro with background image, gradient overlay, call-to-action.

About & Services: Informative, image-backed sections with descriptions.

Contact Form: Styled, form-validated section with success message logic placeholders.

5. Interactive Features (Planned)
Modal windows: Used for Login, Signup, and Forgot Password â€” hidden by default, appear via JavaScript (display: none to block).

Form Validation and Submission: Placeholder methods (handleContactSubmit, etc.) suggest plans for client-side interactivity.

Success Messages: Hidden sections become visible on form submission success.

6. Footer
Contains contact details and social icons, ensuring trust and connectivity.
